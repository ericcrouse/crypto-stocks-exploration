# Exploratory Analysis of Cryptocurrencies and Stock Market Indices

Overview:

This GitHub repository hosts a project that focuses on the bivariate analysis of selected cryptocurrencies and stock market indices. The project aims to explore relationships, correlations, and trends between the values of cryptocurrencies Bitcoin & Ethereum and major stock market indices S&P 500, DOW Jones, Russell 2000, and NASDAQ.

The outline is as follows:

  1. Introduction

  2. Data Collection & Processing

  3. Exploratory Analysis
  
     a. Initial Analysis

         i. Correlation Matrix
  
     b. Continued Exploratory Analysis:

         i. Visuals of Time Series Trends

         ii. Logarithmic Transformation of Variables

         iii. Ordinary Least Squares Regression

         iv. Regression Plots Exploring Characteristics of Specific Representative Variables

  4. Results & Conclusion



The Final Report (in /results) includes static versions of all visuals and summarizes all procedures and findings. 

All code is located in src/DSCI510_Project_Final.ipynb. It can be viewed there, however dynamic visuals will not present in GitHub's environment. 

To run this program yourself and see dynamic visuals:
- Download DSCI510_Project_Final.ipynb from /src
- Download coin_Bitcoin.csv and coin_Ethereum.csv from data/raw
- Open DSCI510_Project_Final.ipynb in a Google Colab environment here: https://colab.research.google.com/
- Upload coin_Bitcoin.csv and coin_Ethereum.csv to session storage in your Colab environment
- Select "Runtime" and choose "Run all"

This project has been designed for your convenience and should run smoothly in a Google Colab environment provided the two .csv files are uploaded to session storage and code cells are run in order. Feel free to reach out to me at ecrouse@usc.edu if there are any difficulties viewing or running.
