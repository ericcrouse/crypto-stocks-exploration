All code is currently contained in a single .ipynb file. This allows users to conveniently "Run all," but is not optimal for future updates and debugging. 

Future versions of this project will feature separate .py files for specific tasks.

The program can be viewed here but visuals are limited in GitHub environment. It is recommended to run the notebook in a Google Colab environment as described in the README.
